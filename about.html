          <h1>Welcome to the Édouard Manet Gallery!</h1>
          <p>A leading artist in the transition from realism to Impressionism, Édouard Manet (1832–1883) was an early Modern painter who claimed city life as a worthy subject for high art. He used a direct, alla prima technique – successive layers of paint on a light ground – to create remarkably vibrant canvases whose opaque flatness and sketch-like passages changed the acceptable norms of painting.</p>

          <p>Born into an upper-class Parisian family, Manet began studying art formally at 18 while spending hours at the Louvre copying the work of Old Masters. Opening a studio in 1856, he produced such masterful early works as <em>The Absinthe Drinker</em> (1858–59); <em>The Luncheon on The Grass</em> (1863), whose nude female shocked critics though its composition was inspired by Old Master precedents; and <em>Olympia</em> (1863), another Old Master-like creation featuring a highly confrontational prostitute. Painting in a quick, loose style, Manet produced many <em>café</em> scenes that captured the population – bohemian, working-class, bourgeois – and the mood of nightlife in 19th-century Paris, as in <em>Le Café Concert</em> (1878). He offered snapshot of the activities of the wealthy in works such as <em>The Races at Longchamp</em> (1864), as well many fresh ways of seeing and understanding Paris: <em>The Railway</em> (1873), for instance, focuses squarely on the figures located hard against the iron fence, and the only sign of a train is a cloud of smoke. With his health deteriorating in his mid-40s, Manet concentrated on painting small still-lifes of fruit and vegetables, producing his last major work, <em>A Bar at the Folies-Bergère</em>, in 1882.</p>
