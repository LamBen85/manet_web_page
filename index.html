            <div class="subtitle"><em>Le Déjeuner sur l'herbe</em>, Manet's first great masterpiece, was rejected by the jury of the 1863 Salon. It was exhibited under the title <em>"Le Bain"</em> at the <em>Salon des Refusés</em>  where it became the principal attraction, generating both laughter and scandal. Yet, Manet was paying tribute to Europe's artistic heritage, borrowing his subject from the <em>"Concert Champêtre"</em> – a painting by Titian – and taking his inspiration for the composition of the central group from the Marcantonio Raimondi engraving after Raphael's "Judgement of Paris". But the classical references were counterbalanced by Manet's boldness. The presence of a nude woman among clothed men is justified neither by mythological nor allegorical precedents. This, and the contemporary dress, rendered the strange and almost unreal scene obscene in the eyes of the public of the day.</div>

            <div class="subtitle"><em>Olympia</em>, which shows a nude woman lying on a bed being brought flowers by a servant, was first exhibited at the 1865 Paris Salon. It has been the subject of numerous outrages and shocked viewers.</div>

            <div class="subtitle">A Bar at the Folies-Bergère is considered to be Manet's last major work. It was painted in 1882 and exhibited at the Paris Salon of that year. It depicts a scene in the <em>Folies-Bergère</em> nightclub in Paris. A barmaid named Suzon is the painting’s still centre. Her enigmatic expression is unsettling, especially as she appears to be interacting with a male customer who is shown in the mirror. Ignoring normal perspective, Manet has shifted their reflection to the right. The bottles on the left are similarly misaligned in the mirror. This play of reflections emphasises the disorientating atmosphere of the bustling <em>Folies-Bergère</em>. Manet created a complex, absorbing composition and one of the iconic paintings of modern life.</div>

            <div class="subtitle">One of Manet’s earlier paintings, Music in the Tuileries Garden (1862) shows the influence of Frans Hals and Diego Velázquez on Manet’s artistic style. The quick visible brush strokes seemed to some to indicate that the painting was not finished, but it is a true representation of what the Tuilerie gardens were like, crowded and full of noise.</div>

            <div class="subtitle">Manet drew to a close a long series of "women on a sofa" with this painting from 1873. His model is Nina de Callias, a capricious woman, alternately elated and depressed, with a neurotic temperament that alcohol soon led her to insanity and a premature death at the age of thirty-nine.</div>

            <div class="subtitle">The Gare Saint–Lazare - the largest and busiest train station in Paris in 1873 - is unseen in this painting. Manet submitted four works to the Paris Salon of 1874. Of the four, only two were accepted, The Railway and a watercolor. Reviewers were critical of the unfinished appearance of The Railway and that the rail station itself was not well–defined in the picture.</div>

            <div class="subtitle">The Execution of Emperor Maximilian is a series of paintings by Édouard Manet from 1867 to 1869, depicting the execution by firing squad of Emperor Maximilian I of the short-lived Second Mexican Empire. It is one of the few works in which Manet seeks a dramatic effect.</div>

          <div class="img-text-wrapper">

            <div class="subtitle">The Head of Christ, 1864. Manet was not particularly religious. As a realist, he rejected the Romantic, mystic, and religious themes of the past and preferred subjects of contemporary life. Yet, he painted a few major works portraying Jesus Christ. Art historians are somewhat puzzled by this fact. One usual explanation is that Manet wanted to preserve art traditions, although in a distinctly modern way. Another explanation suggests that Manet was still searching for his own style and theme at this stage, and tried all traditions including religious themes.</div>

          <div class="img-text-wrapper">

            <div class="subtitle">On a trip to Spain in 1865, Édouard Manet visited the Prado, where the art of Diego Velázquez was a revelation. Upon his return to Paris in 1866, he began working on The Fifer, a painting depicting an anonymous regimental fifer of the Spanish army. Manet presents the uniformed boy in a manner that imitates and inverts the formula of Vélazquez's court portraits, against a barely inflected, flattened background of neutral tone. The painting was rejected by the jury of the Salon of 1866.</div>
